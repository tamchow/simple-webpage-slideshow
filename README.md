# [Simple Webpage Slideshow](https://github.com/tamchow/simple-webpage-slideshow)
Simple JS (ES6) and CSS(3) based image slideshows for webpages.

## In Action
1. Plain jQuery version [here](https://tamchow.github.io/simple-webpage-slideshow/slideshow_base_example.html)
2. jQuery + CSS transitions for best of both worlds [here](https://tamchow.github.io/simple-webpage-slideshow/slideshow_css_example.html)

## Features
1. Position indicator with click-to-seek
2. Previous and next buttons with wrap on overflow (infinite slideshow)
3. Right-click on previous button to go to the first and on next button to go to the last image in a slideshow
4. Cool, depth-effect transitions

## Compatibility
Uses only standard CSS with no vendor prefixes, so may not be compatible with older browsers. 
The end user can add the necessary vendor prefixes if required.

## Image Licensing
The images used for the examples are not open-source, and may **not** be used anywhere at all other than the example pages visible 
[here](https://tamchow.github.io/simple-webpage-slideshow/slideshow_base_example.html) and 
[here](https://tamchow.github.io/simple-webpage-slideshow/slideshow_css_example.html)
without my prior express permission.

## Use
Mostly plug-and-chug. Almost everything is customizable via JS or CSS variables;
look in the example HTML files for how to set up the HTML for a slideshow.

**Yes**, multiple slideshows in a single page are properly supported.
